# JavaScript Advanced

In the "JS Advanced" course, I got in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. Also more complex concepts like function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course developed my algorithmic thinking as well. After successfully completing this course, I have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be explored, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and the prototype chain.
